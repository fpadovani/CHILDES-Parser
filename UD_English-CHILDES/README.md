# Summary

This repository contains Universal Dependencies (UD) trees for utterances from child–adult spoken interactions in English, drawn from [CHILDES](https://childes.talkbank.org/) transcripts.

# Introduction
This treebank is built based on three existing treebanks (details under [References](#references)).
We compile, harmonize, and manually correct major UD-style annotations of CHILDES data into a consistent, unified UD format,
resulting in a gold-standard treebank of 48K sentences and 236K tokens.

## Train, dev, test split statistics

| split | Children  | Corpus | Gold Sents |
|-------|-----------|---------|------------|
| Train | Adam, Lily, Naima, Sarah, Roman, Laura, Abe | Brown, Providence, Weist, Kuczaj, Braunwald| 34,732     |
| Dev   | Adam, Lily, Naima, Sarah, Roman, Laura, Abe    | Brown, Providence, Weist, Kuczaj, Braunwald | 3,860      |

## Example
```
# sent_id = 24433               (normalized sentence ID across corpora; used to avoid collisions since some corpora share identical sentence IDs)
# original_sent_id = 1715344    (original sentence ID from the corpus, as assigned in CHILDES-R)
# childes_toks = a world of Easter   (original token string from CHILDES-R)
# child_name = Adam
# corpus_name = Brown
# gold_annotation = True
# speaker_age = 31.03           (speaker's age in months)
# speaker_gender = male         (child's gender)
# speaker_role = Mother         (speaker role in conversation)
# type = trail off              (sentence type annotation)
# text = A world of Easter.

```
